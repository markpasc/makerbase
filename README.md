# makerbase #

Makerbase is a directory of people who make bits and atoms and the things they made. It's like IMDb for web sites, apps, tools, toys and stuff.

It's really new and not so great and we're working on it. Check out the demo at [makerbase.neologasm.org][1] or [the source code on GitHub][2] (or presumably wherever this file is since you're reading it).
